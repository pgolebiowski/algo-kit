# AlgoKit
Yet another toolkit of algorithms and data structures for .NET developers. 

## Purpose
The project has two main purposes:

1. Provide tools that are handy, intuitive, and highly effective in practice.
2. Write heavily documented and carefully designed code so that people can easily understand it and learn from it.

By fulfilling these purposes, AlgoKit is intended to stand out from the gazillion of other libraries as a solution of top quality.

## Implemented

### Heaps
* Binary heaps,
* Quaternary heaps,
* d-ary heaps,
* Binomial heaps,
* Pairing heaps.

## To do next
* Write docs on how to use heaps,
* Provide performance tests.
